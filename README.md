# NeuralNetworks

This repo contains a toy Python module (in development) for simple Neural Networks.

The intention is to build the network functionality from scratch, to gain an in-depth understanding of NN learning.

1. Develop the feedforward functionality for simple networks.
2. Develop a simple gradient descent algorithm.
3. Extend this to allow stochastic gradient descent.
4. Add the backpropagation algorithm to speed things up.
